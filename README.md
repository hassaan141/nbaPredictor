# NBA Game Predictor

A machine learning model that forecasts NBA game outcomes using historical performance data. Built with **Python**, it analyzes recent matchups and predicts win/loss results with **64% accuracy** using **ridge regression**.

---

## Overview

This project uses a team's last 10 games against specific opponents to predict the outcome of upcoming NBA matches. Key stats include:

- Field goals
- Minutes played
- Three-point attempts
- Shot attempts

The data is processed and modeled using a **ridge regression** approach in **Jupyter Notebook** for fast iteration and visualization.
